# master-thesis
Here you find all scripts I created during writing my master thesis.

The aim of this thesis is to explore and research the entrainment and retention potential of the waters above Ewing Seamount,
specifically the role of the utilized model formulations. Data from different model configurations are used: The high-resolution
basin-scale 1/20Â° (~5 km grid size) model INALT20 and regional ultra-high-resolution configuration based on ROMS at resolutions
of 1500 and 500 m. Particle experiments with OceanParcels shall be performed to test the exchange of water above the seamounts
with the surrounding deep ocean. Entrainment and retention and advective in relation to ocean currents shall be described and quantified.
